# Spotify Artist Analysis

This project is a web application that allows users to analyze their top artists on Spotify using the Spotify API, OpenAI API, and data visualization. The application generates a pie chart displaying the user's top 10 artists in the last month, along with a creative description generated by OpenAI's language model. Additionally, the application creates an image representing the creative description using OpenAI's image generation capabilities.

## Features

- **Spotify Authentication**: Users can authenticate with their Spotify accounts to access their listening data.
- **Top Artists Analysis**: The application retrieves the user's top 10 artists in the last month using the Spotify API.
- **Pie Chart Visualization**: A pie chart is generated to visually represent the user's top artists and their popularity.
- **Creative Description Generation**: OpenAI's language model is used to generate a creative description based on the genres of the user's top artists.
- **Image Generation**: An image representing the creative description is generated using OpenAI's image generation capabilities.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The backend of the application is built using Python.
- **Flask**: The web framework used for building the application.
- **Spotipy**: A Python library for interacting with the Spotify Web API.
- **OpenAI API**: Used for generating creative descriptions and images based on the user's top artist data.
- **Matplotlib**: A Python plotting library used for generating the pie chart visualization.
- **HTML/CSS**: Used for structuring and styling the web pages.
